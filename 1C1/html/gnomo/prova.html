		<h1>The Story of the World Wide Web</h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of interlinked hypertext documents that are accessed via the Internet. It was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he was working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
		<h1>The Early Years</h1>
		<p>Berners-Lee proposed a system that would allow researchers to share their documents and follow links to related information. He called it "Mesh", but it was later renamed to the "World Wide Web". The first web page was published on August 6, 1991, and it explained what the World Wide Web was and how to use it.</p>
		<h1>The Browser Wars</h1>
		<p>In the mid-1990s, several companies released web browsers that competed for market share. Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer were the most popular, and they engaged in a series of battles for dominance. This period is known as the "Browser Wars", and it led to the development of new features and technologies that made the web more powerful and accessible.</p>
		<h1>The Rise of Mobile</h1>
		<p>In the 2000s, mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets became increasingly popular. This led to the development of mobile web browsers and responsive web design, which allows websites to adjust their layout and content based on the size of the screen.</p>
		<h1>The Future of the Web</h1>
		<p>The World Wide Web continues to evolve and grow, with new technologies and standards being developed all the time. Some of the most exciting developments include virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT). These technologies have the potential to revolutionize the way we live, work, and play, and they will shape the future of the web for years to come.</p>
